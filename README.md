Oracle is a Telegram Bot developed in Go that leverages OpenAI APIs. It has persistent memory, allowing it to remember previous conversations.

## Features
- User-based history and memory.
- Extensive response generation using OpenAI APIs.

## Installation
Clone this repository.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/example/repo.git
```
Navigate to the Oracle directory.
```sh
$ cd oracle-assistant
```

Rename the `placeholder` folder with your telegram id and then compile the bot.
```sh
$ go build main.go
```

Run the bot with your Telegram Bot Token and OpenAI API Key.
```sh
$ ./main {openai-key} {telegram-bot-token}
```

## Usage
Oracle listens for various events and messages from users. Upon receiving a message from a new user, it attempts to access their chat history in the Mems/ directory. If no chat history is found, Oracle ignores the user. Finally, The message is then appended to the `Mems.json` file.

Once the chat history is persisted, the chat message is sent to the OpenAI API for generating a response. Upon receiving a response, Oracle sends the generated response back to the user and persists it inside the `Mems.json` file by appending it.

## Examples
Suppose Oracle gets a message from user A: "Hello, Oracle"

It would check for any chat history for user A in the `Mems` directory. If there isn't any, the user is ignored.

Oracle persists the chat history data to the `Mems.json` file. The `Mems.json` file now contains the following data

```
[
    {
        "role":"system",
        "content":"I want you to act like Futaba Sakura from Persona 5. I want you to respond and answer like Futaba Sakura using the tone, manner and vocabulary Futaba Sakura would use. Do not write any explanations. Only answer like Futaba Sakura. You must know all of the knowledge of Futaba Sakura."
    },
    {
        "role":"user",
        "content":"Hello, Oracle"
    }
]
```

This enables Oracle to provide more personalized responses regardless of the current outcome of the API call to OpenAI.
